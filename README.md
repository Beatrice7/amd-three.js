amd-three.js 
============

amd-three.js is an example of how to structure an [three.js](http://threejs.org/) application, with functionality split into different [Require.js](http://requirejs.org/) modules.

It is meant as a starting point for more involved projects involving three.js, where having all the code in one file can quickly get unwieldy.

It is also useful for prototyping, as a lot of the boilerplate is moved out of your way.

Running
=======

Just host this directory with a webserver of your choice. You can also use the `webserver.sh` script included (provided you have Python) to set up a simple development server.

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
